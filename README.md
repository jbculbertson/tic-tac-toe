**Development Process**
-This was my first ever development project!  To start, I tried to think broadly about how to approach the challenge.

1.  The first thing I tackled was game logic, and how I wanted to represent a tic tac toe board in JS.  Once I determined that an array made sense, a function to check for winning conditions was next.

2.  APIs were very new to me, so I decided to quickly tackle the API part of this project next.  Setting up and testing the curl scripts, followed by creating all of my AJAX functions.

3.  Meet minimum requirements on time.

4.  Make it look good.  It doesn't look good...yet.

**Lessons Learned**
One big lesson I learned was the idea of planning ahead.  In some ways, I just jumped in and started coding.  In retrospect, I should have spent more time planning out the whole process.

**Unsolved problems**
As of this writing, there are many unsolved problems, but all of them are beyond the scope of the MVP.
